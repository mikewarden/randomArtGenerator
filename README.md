# randomArtGenerator
randomArtGenerator makes use of random Math variables assigned to canvas coordinates. 

The random Math values can be added, erased or modified to allow for more randomness.
However, Some of the canvas coordinates could benefit from linking or sharing coordinates with other strokes to give some geometric cohesion.
